    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out
            with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder.
            Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity.
            Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior.
            Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone
            and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh,
            near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
            Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings.
            Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
