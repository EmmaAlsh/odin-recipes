    <h2>Crepes for breakfast</h2>
    <p> Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes.
        It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. 
            Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine.
            Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
            Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. 
            Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
