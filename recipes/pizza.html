    <h2>The most delicious pizza</h2>
    <p> This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. 
        You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! 
        It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>

    </ul>
